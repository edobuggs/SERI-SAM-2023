UTiLIA: Lockin analyzer for superconductivity experiment

UTiLIA is released under the GPL. (c) Philip Kromer, 1999

UTiLIA-Channels.daq:	In NIMax (Measurement and Automation Explorer) choose 
				Tools / NI-DAQ Configuration / Set Active Configuration;
				Choose this file to load its channels.
				You will need to fix the device info for for each channel
				to the correct DAQ device.


UTiLIA-Main:		Where most of it goes down.  
				It sets up:
				 - Compute the reference frequency, sampling freq, 
				   # of chunks, bits / chunk, etc.  There are actually 
				   a _lot_ of constraints on these values; that's why 
				   they're chosen the way they are.
				 - Initializes the acquisition:
				   Configures the board to generate reference;
				   Configures the board to read analog inputs;
				   Set up software triggered acquisition.
				     (Soft triggering is the wrong thing to do -- 
				      much better to do hardware triggering on the analog 
				      out clock, or better yet to do continuous aq)
				
				Next it enters a while loop. Each iteration: 
				 - Read the data
				 - Plot the raw waveforms and the reference
				 - Plot the FFT of the signals

				 - Lock in to extract the signal
				 - Find a short and long term average
				 - Plot the locked / filtered / averaged signals
				 - Plot the error vs. time
				
				 - Record values to disk
					Order of columns in saved data file:
					Iteration
					Current
					In-Phase Voltage
					Quadrature Voltage
					Temperature
				
				 - Some magic to clear the graphs while the average 
				   is "dirty" (has not rolled for long enough to be useful)

				If the stop button is pressed or an error occurs, 
				the program cleans up and exits.

In UTiLIA-Helpers.llb:
  SetupAq.vi		Initializes the acquisition:
				   Configures the board to generate reference;
				   Configures the board to read analog inputs;
				   Set up software triggered acquisition.
				     (Soft triggering is the wrong thing to do -- 
				      much better to do hardware triggering on the analog 
				      out clock, or better yet to do continuous aq)

  Aq.vi			Performs the actual acquisiton 

  Lock.vi			Does actual lockin and filtering.

  RollingAverage.vi	Makes a short-term (chunk) average 
				and a long-term (80 chunk rolling exp) average

  XYBuffer.vi		Holds a circular buffer so that individual X-Y values
				gathered each trip thru the loop may be displayed 
				on a waveform graph.
